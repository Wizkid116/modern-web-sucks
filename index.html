  <h1>The modern web is garbage</h1>
  <p>I wrote this piece of shit in webstorm just to prove a point,</p>
  <p>and now Snap is taking up space on my computer,</p>
  <p>fuck.</p>
  <p> </p>

  <h1>"But why is it garbage?"</h1>
  <p>There's a 1001 things I could list, but I'll just skim the top:</p>

  <h2>Featurecreep</h2>
  <p>Nowadays, it seems every website has to gargle 20Mb of CSS and nodeJS cock just to render a fancy little animation that nobody's gonna give a shit about or even notice.</p>
  <p>This site uses no CSS, no JavaScript, no Google analytical bullshit, and yet still gets my point across in just a few kilobytes of html!</p>
  <p>On top of that, it's fast as shit, runs on anything, and will look the same everywhere!</p>

  <h1>Eyecandy</h1>
  <p>"OOOH but wut about muh animations?! I gotta have my fancy styling!"</p>
  <p>All for what? To slow down loading times and make your sites unfocused and overcomplicated?</p>
  <p>"Look at me! I made my website more animated than a middle schooler's PowerPoint presentation! Someone pat me on the back for all my totally necessary work!</p>
  <p>"Muh stylins, muh professionalisms!"</p>
  <p>Here's a thought: suck muh ballz!</p>
  <p>A website should be for getting your point across, not a dick-measuring contest over who can write the most JavaScript. Stop wasting my time and load the damn page already!</p>

  <h1>JavaScript</h1>
  <p>Ah yes, the dumpster fire based on the king of boilerplate that is Java, that then took 25 years and several 3rd party libraries to make halfway decent: JavaScript.</p>
  <p>Because the web was getting bloated enough, let's just top it off with even MORE bloat?</p>
  <p>Why? Because <a href="https://github.com/denysdovhan/wtfjs">1+1=11</a></p>

  <h1>Yes, this is satire, you fuck.</h1>
  <p>Everything has its uses, and its flaws. It's just the problems that we developers create ourselves that boils my piss.</p>
  <p>The web has the potential to be fast, accessible, functional, and beautiful.</p>
  <p>All you have to do is make it not suck.</p>

  <h1>More to come...</h1>
  <p>There's always more. Click <a href="https://github.com/Wizkid116/modern-web-sucks" title="Wizkid116/Modern-Web-Sucks on GitHub">here</a> if YOU can improve on perfection.</p>
